initial setup

## Video 2 (simple graph)
> In this video we learned how to add nodes and edges to the graph. 
  conditional edges can be used that decide which node to point to based on the user input, here we just used a randomiser function 
  I went ahead and made an example that in the end of this file, in this dummy scenario we do a web search or open a calculator or pass input to a general llm query
